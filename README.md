The Student Requirements System of Eötvös Loránd University
(ELTE Organizational and Operational Regulations, Vol. II, §74/C) states that as long as a student presents
the work of another student - or at least a significant part of it - as their own, it is considered a disciplinary offense.
The most severe consequence of such an offense is the student's expulsion from the university.
